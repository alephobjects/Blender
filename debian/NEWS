blender (2.43-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * As of 2.43, one needs to use a ``YESIAMSTUPID'' macro in
    source/creator/creator.c to be able to compile Blender on a 64-bit system.
    This matter has not been advertised, but it mainly resides in the fact
    that Blender is not 64-bit safe, in particular with respect to saved and
    loaded files, especially when that happens between 32-bit and 64-bit
    systems. Attention was paid to 64-bit systems, efforts were made, but not
    enough to get a releasable version on those systems.

  * So, be aware that there might be issues with files manipulated on 64-bit
    systems, although everything could be or look fine. The file format might
    also change in further releases to make it 64-bit safe, which might lead
    to incompatibilities with the files saved with the current 64-bit builds.

  * The lead developer also promised (on #blendercoders/Freenode):
      ``We won't do another release without 64 bits blender!''
    This problem is a priority, and it will be addressed in CVS as soon as
    possible. Hopefully in some months, a 64-bit Blender will be released.

  * Related code modifications are stored in Blender debianized sources, in
    debian/patches/01_64bits_stupidity.dpatch.
