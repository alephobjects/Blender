blender (2.45-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ User-visible changes ]
  * Rework the blender wrapper. As it was written, it might discard user
    customization in the ~/.blender directory. Now, a subdirectory named
    after the previous version number is created, and previous
    configuration items are stored there before updating to the latest
    data shipped by upstream. This way, last features are available by
    default, while previous configuration is still accessible if needed.
  * The wrapper also used to create many symlinks under ~/.blender/scripts
    and has now been modified to rather create a single symlink per
    package. Other packages can now ship Blender scripts under
    /usr/share/blender/scripts/$package, and a symlink to this directory
    will be added automatically during the next startup.
  * Previous links (to /usr/lib/blender/…) should also be removed
    automatically.

  [ Great cleanup ]
  * Switch from python-central to python-support:
     - debian/control:
        - B-D: Replace python-central with python-support.
        - B-D: Replace python2.4-dev with python-dev.
        - Drop python-centralish additional fields: X{S,B}-Python-Version.
     - debian/rules:
        - Replace dh_pycentral with dh_pysupport.
  * Remove the homepage from the long description.
  * Remove the binary and source lintian overrides about the additional
    “Homepage” source field, which is now official.
  * Replace many “install” calls in debian/rules by a call to“
    dh_install” and appropriate lines in debian/blender.install.That also
    fixes the spurious installation of the SVG icon in a 32x32 icon folder.
  * Move the locales where they belong: /usr/share/locale. Remove the symlink
    from the wrapper, it is no longer needed.
  * Remove the dot from the filenames of the Blanguages and bfont.ttf files,
    so that they no longer appear as hidden. Also move them to /usr/share.
    Modify the wrapper accordingly, so that it symlinks to the new locations.
    Also add a TODO about a possible removal of the font symlink.
  * Also move the scripts hierarchy and the VERSION file to /usr/share. Adapt
    the wrapper for this purpose too. Adapt the “chmod” call in debian/rules
    accordingly.
  * Drop the optimization lowering on mips(el) from debian/rules, although
    #354439 isn't marked as fixed yet. Thanks to Arthur Loiret for checking
    that the build goes fine with current gcc version.
  * Actually drop the “ccache” detection introduced in 2.45-1. Setting the
    PATH is much more straightforward.
  * General cleanup of debian/rules, especially superfluous use of $(CURDIR).
  * Delete “image-file-in-usr-lib” lintian override. No longer needed due to
    the /usr/lib to /usr/share migration of most of the files (nor really
    justified anyway).
  * No longer ship bfont.ttf directly since it is a duplicate of Bitstream
    Vera. Ship a symlink to the appopriate font and add a Depends: on the
    ttf-bitstream-vera package. Thanks linda.
  * Modify the handling of the config.* files. They are listed at the top of
    debian/rules and this list should be refreshed for each upstream release.
  * Modify the tweaks for the build of the plugins, using a symlink now.
  * Move the conditional addition (on Linux architectures only) of libdc1394
    to the patch against config/linux2-config.py.
  * Convert the patch system from dpatch to quilt. As a reminder, they are
    currently:
     - 02_tmp_in_HOME, by Florian Ernst:
         Create all temporary user data in $HOME/.blender, preventing
         possible security issues (e.g. symlink attacks, see #298167).
     - 04_de_po_fix, by Florian Ernst:
         Little fixes for de.po, by Jens Seidel <jensseidel@users.sf.net>,
         reported to the upstream patch tracker as #7823.
     - 10_gnukfreebsd_support by me:
         Add support for GNU/kFreeBSD in upstream files, see #388349.
     - 20_gcc4.3_support by me:
         Fix FTBFS with GCC 4.3 (Closes: #462116).
     - 50_debian_build_config by me:
         Customize the upstream default Linux configuration. Diffs are
         listed in TODO at the moment, until a dedicated file is added.
  * Modify the handling of user-config.py: config/linux2-config is now
    symlinked at build time from user-config.py, so that non-Linux
    architectures use it, although the auto-detection doesn't find the
    matching configuration file. The symlink is removed at clean time.
  * Drop no longer needed files:
     - debian/dirs
     - debian/genpot/*
     - debian/misc/user-config.py
     - debian/pot-header.txt
     - debian/pycompat
  * Adapt the wrapper so that other packages can ship scripts under a
    given directory (/usr/share/blender/scripts/$package) and that those
    scripts are taken into account when blender is started (using the same
    symlink mechanism that was already present for the scripts shipped
    with blender).
  * Update the menu file, providing with better long titles, thanks to
    Bill Allombert (Closes: #445154).
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3 (no change needed).
  * Add Vcs-{Git,Browser} fields, pointing to collab-maint.
  * No longer run “uupdate” in debian/watch.
  * Drop linda overrides, it looks like a outdated and deprecated tool.
  * Remove Florian Ernst from Uploaders upon his request, thanks for
    your taking care until now!

blender (2.45-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #443278).
  * Menu transition: move from Apps/Graphics to Applications/Graphics.
  * Dropped patch (merged upstream):
     - 20_gcc4.3_support.dpatch.
  * Disabled genpot in debian/rules. It is very time consuming, and apparently
    not needed. If a regression happens, it should be fixed upstream, and not
    using such a hack (that nobody knows about anymore). The genpot/ folder
    hadn't be deleted (yet), just in case. Since these scripts aren't called
    anymore, no .pyc file should appear, which fixes the double-build failure
    (Closes: #442511).
  * Added a “Homepage:” field, and kept the URL in the long description,
    until packages.debian.org, aptitude, and so on support this field.
  * Modified debian/rules to detect when DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS contains
    “ccache”, so as to speed up maintainer rebuilds.
  * Updated lintian source overrides so that only the following ones remain:
     - “unknown-field-in-dsc homepage” (see above);
     - .svn files in the upstream source.
  * Updated lintian binary overrides:
     - deleted unused ones;
     - added “unknown-field-in-control homepage”;
  * Updated desktop files:
     - removed unneeded “Encoding” field;
     - updated “Category” field “Application;Graphics;” to
       “Graphics;3DGraphics;”.

blender (2.44-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added debian/patches/20_gcc4.3_support.dpatch to fix FTBFS with GCC 4.3.
    Solves:
     - many missing includes;
     - one missing newline;
     - one redefinition.
    (Closes: #417491)
  * Rebuild will turn libav{codec,format}0d Depends: into libav{codec,format}1d,
    thus fixing the impossibility to install blender (Closes: #427567).

blender (2.44-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Drop debian/patches/01_64bits_stupidity, not needed anymore: as of this
    version blender is 64 bits safe again. Adjust README.Debian accordingly.

blender (2.43-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * New upstream release (Closes: #414409).
  * Refreshed 10_gnukfreebsd_support.dpatch:
     - it should now support each FreeBSD kernel version, using startswith()
       instead of an hardcoded kernel version string;
     - nan_compile.mk and some other files are no longer patched, although the
       compilation is OK; adjustments might be needed.
  * Updated user-config.py:
     - fixed () vs {} for FFMPEG;
     - switched from 'bullet' to 'bullet2' and adjusted some paths.
  * Added a Build-Conflicts against nvidia-glx. When trying to build with that
    package installed, a ``-lGL not found otherwise'' occurs, and without it,
    everything looks fine. That should also avoid situations like in #282071
    and #285946.
  * Added debian/patches/01_64bits_stupidity.dpatch to enable blender on
    64-bit systems. Please read the README.Debian file for more info. A
    NEWS.Debian file has been added to ensure that users don't miss this
    point.
  * Adjusted README.Debian file so that it has the very same structure as a
    debian changelog file.
  * Adjusted the clean target since many binary files remained after the
    cleanup, reported by dpkg-buildpackage when trying to update the Debian
    diff after a build (Closes: #424145).
  * Adjusted the width of the lines in the long description to get a possibly
    beautiful paragraph.
  * Updated and improved desktop integration (Closes: #417901):
     - switched from a single desktop file to two versions: one for windowed
       and one for fullscreen execution, thanks to Lukas Fittl for the
       suggestion!
     - added the missing dh_desktop call;
     - added the installation of all the icons in release/freedesktop/icons;
     - adapted the icon name in the .desktop files accordingly.
  * Dropped insecure script removal introduced in 2.42a-6, since the insecure
    script is no longer shipped upstream.
  * Added a TODO(.Debian) file to list items to work on for further revisions.

  [ Florian Ernst ]
  * debian/control:
    + drop g++-3.3 from B-D. Actually, we don't need it anymore.
    + bump B-D on python-central to 0.5 to make lintian happy.

blender (2.42a-7) unstable; urgency=high

  * Dropped the erroneous -lstdc++ and -lc linking options, which caused the
    FTBFS on mips and sparc; let g++ do the job instead, using CXX. Many
    thanks to Sam Hocevar <sam@zoy.org> for having found the cause of the
    FTBFS and for the patch (Closes: #417889).
  * Urgency set to high accordingly, since it is a serious bug.

  * Security: No longer ship the kmz_ImportWithMesh.py script since it allows
    user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary Python code by
    importing a crafted (1) KML or (2) KMZ file [CVE-2007-1253].
  * Updated copyright to reflect the actual license (Closes: #407917).
  * Added documentation (NEWS, README.Debian) about 64-bit related risks.
  * Added myself to the Uploaders.

  * urgency=high due to RC bugfix targetted at testing
  * debian/control: add explicit Build-Depends on pkg-config which was
    previously pulled in automatically via a dependency chain, thus
    resolving a FTBFS (Closes: #397560)

  * debian/rules: remove dh_python call as dh_pycentral should do the work
  * debian/genpot/*.py: convert DOS to Unix line endings, thanks to Jens
    Seidel for the pointer
  * debian/blender.1: update by Cyril Brulebois, many thanks (Closes: #394224)

  * debian/rules: delete config.{guess,sub} in clean

blender (2.42a-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Add support for GNU/kFreeBSD (kfreebsd-i386 at least, closes: #388349):
    - Add 10_gnukfreebsd_support.dpatch to solve GNU/kFreeBSD detection in
      SConstruct files and other #define's.
    - Conditionalize the removal of "libdc1394" in debian/rules because it is
      Linux-specific and used unconditionally. Should be more easy to maintain
      this way than having multiple user-config.py files.

  [ Florian Ernst ]
  * Fall back to using gcc-3.4/g++-3.4 on mips and mipsel in order to
    circumvent ICE, see bug#354439.
  * Merge changes from Ubuntu:
    - debian/genpot: Add python scripts from Lee June <blender@eyou.com> to
      generate a reasonable PO template from the sources. Since gettext is used
      in a highly nonstandard way, xgettext does not work for this job.
    - debian/rules: Call the scripts, generate po/blender.pot, and clean it up
      in the clean target.
    - Add a proper header to the generated PO template.
  * Readd B-D on autotools-dev for auto-updating of config.{sub,guess},
    GNU/kFreeBSD seems to need it.
