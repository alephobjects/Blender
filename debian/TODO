Some items to work on:
 * Adjust the manpage, if needed.
 * Maybe add nvidia-glx-legacy as Build-Conflicts. Bartosz Fe≈Ñski has
   been mailed to get more info about the nvidia-glx problem. (Is there
   a less intrusive way to get the appropriate symbols without
   conflicting?)
 * Add explanations about what to do when X crashes, and point to
   HowToGetAnXBacktrace on wiki.debian.org once this part is updated to
   Xorg.
 * Eventually drop the bfont.ttf symlink since strace doesn't show any
   open attempts on this file, and the text tool looks like working OK.
   Check the source and ask blendercoders to be sure.
 * Check that dropping the mips(el) test in debian/rules doesn't lead
   to FBTFS on these architectures.
 * Check some steps in debian/rules, marked [CHECK]. Mostly:
    - Check whether building the plugins by hand is still needed.
    - Check the additional clean steps are still needed.

More items have been mentioned on the list, see the thread beginning at:
