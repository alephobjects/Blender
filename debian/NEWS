blender (2.42a-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * Blender is not 64-bit safe (yet), in particular with respect to saved and
    loaded files, especially when that happens between 32-bit and 64-bit
    systems. Attention was paid to 64-bit systems, efforts were made, but not
    enough to get a releasable version on those systems.

  * So, be aware that there might be issues with files manipulated on 64-bit
    systems, although everything could be or look fine. The file format might
    also change in further releases to make it 64-bit safe, which might lead
    to incompatibilities with the files saved with the current 64-bit builds.

  * More information is available in the README.Debian file, available under
    /usr/share/doc/blender/.
