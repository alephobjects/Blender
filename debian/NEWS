blender (2.43-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * As of 2.43, one needs to use a ``YESIAMSTUPID'' (sigh...) macro in
    source/creator/creator.c to be able to run Blender on a 64-bit system.
    According to the developers hanging on #blendercoders/freenode (since
    there is no release note about that on the website...), there
    could be troubles with files exchanged between 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
    See debian/patches/01_64bits_stupidity.dpatch for the diff.

  * Also, the file format might change in further releases, so you might be
    unable to reopen the files you saved with current Blender releases, with
    later releases (once the 64-bit problems are solved).

  * Apparently (seen in a comment on BlenderNation, and on IRC, but once
    again, nothing on the website...), this problem won't be addressed until
    2.50 release, since they don't look like caring much about 64-bit (I was
    told that one needs several GB RAM to benefit from it, and also that not
    much applications nor OSes run on 64-bit, so...).
