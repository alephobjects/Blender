Some items to work on:
 * Adjust the manpage, if needed.
 * Maybe add nvidia-glx-legacy as Build-Conflicts. Bartosz Fe≈Ñski has
   been mailed to get more info about the nvidia-glx problem. (Is there
   a less intrusive way to get the appropriate symbols without
   conflicting?)
 * Add explanations about what to do when X crashes, and point to
   HowToGetAnXBacktrace on wiki.debian.org once this part is updated to
   Xorg.
 * Eventually drop the bfont.ttf symlink since strace doesn't show any
   open attempts on this file, and the text tool looks like working OK.
   Check the source and ask blendercoders to be sure.
 * Check that dropping the mips(el) test in debian/rules doesn't lead
   to FBTFS on these architectures.
 * Check whether it is possible to make the build fail when the
   plugins aren't built. The build fails on the dh_install call anyway
   but it might be better to have it fail before build-stamp is
   touched.
 * Document the divergences between the original and the debianized
   config/linux2-config.py so that the patch stays maintainable.
