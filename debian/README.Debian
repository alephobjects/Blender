blender (2.42a-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * As of 2.43, one needs to use a ``YESIAMSTUPID'' macro in
    source/creator/creator.c to be able to compile Blender on a 64-bit system.
    This matter has not been advertised, but it mainly resides in the fact
    that Blender is not 64-bit safe, in particular with respect to saved and
    loaded files, especially when that happens between 32-bit and 64-bit
    systems. Attention was paid to 64-bit systems, efforts were made, but not
    enough to get a releasable version on those systems.

  * So, be aware that there might be issues with files manipulated on 64-bit
    systems, although everything could be or look fine. The file format might
    also change in further releases to make it 64-bit safe, which might lead
    to incompatibilities with the files saved with the current 64-bit builds.

  * After the 2.43 release, the lead developer also promised (on Freenode, on
    the #blendercoders chan):
      ``We won't do another release without 64 bits blender!''
    This problem is a priority, and it will be addressed in CVS as soon as
    possible, possibly for 2.44.

  * Interested readers might want to refer to the following thread on
    upstream's bf-committers list:

blender (2.40-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * As blender is generally trying to get the most out of your graphics
    hardware it might trigger bugs in the corresponding drivers without
    actually being responsible for any malfunctioning.  If you experience
    strange crashes please always try checking your setup first as outlined in
      http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/TestingAndDebugging

    as well as the Debian bugreport
      http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=273651

    I.e., try running blender via "LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1 blender" and see
    whether this will resolve the problem for you.

  * Furthermore, please note that starting with the 2.40-1 release blender
    will quit writing its autosave files to /tmp but it will use
    $HOME/.blender/ instead by default.
