blender (2.53-beta-svn30596-1) experimental; urgency=low
  Important changes in this upload:
     - /usr/bin/blender is no longer a shell wrapper for
       /usr/bin/blender-bin, it's now the real binary.
     - Rationale: maintaining a bunch of symlinks (from ~/.blender to the
       scripts directories under /usr/share/blender…) was really a mess,
       let's just forget about this. Having some sort of search path
       really is the way to go.
     - The patch tweaking the temporary directory has been dropped for
       now, so one probably should be warned about possible race
       conditions in /tmp. Maybe that's going to be fixed upstream some
       day; in the meanwhile, that's an upload to experimental…
     - Localization seems not to be working (see changelog).
