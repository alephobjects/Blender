Some items to work on:
 * Adjust the overrides, are they (still) all needed?
 * Adjust the manpage, if needed.
 * Maybe add nvidia-glx-legacy as Build-Conflicts. Bartosz Fe≈Ñski has
   been mailed to get more info about the nvidia-glx problem. (Is there
   a less intrusive way to get the appropriate symbols without
   conflicting?)
 * Maybe use folding and several paragraphs in the long description.
 * Add explanations about what to do when X crashes, and point to
   HowToGetAnXBacktrace on wiki.debian.org once this part is updated to
   Xorg.

More items have been mentioned on the list, see the thread beginning at:
