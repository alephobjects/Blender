TODO for blender:
-----------------

  * Adjust the manpage, if needed (should be merged usptream).
  * Maybe add nvidia-glx-legacy as Build-Conflicts. Bartosz Fe≈Ñski has
    been mailed to get more info about the nvidia-glx problem. (Is there
    a less intrusive way to get the appropriate symbols without
    conflicting?)
  * Add explanations about what to do when X crashes, and point to
    HowToGetAnXBacktrace on wiki.debian.org once this part is updated to
    Xorg.
  * Eventually drop the bfont.ttf symlink since strace doesn't show any
    open attempts on this file, and the text tool looks like working OK.
    Check the source and ask blendercoders to be sure.
  * Check whether it is possible to make the build fail when the
    plugins aren't built. The build fails on the dh_install call anyway
    but it might be better to have it fail before build-stamp is
    touched.
  * Document the divergences between the original and the debianized
    config/linux2-config.py so that the patch stays maintainable.
    At the moment:
     - Build in ., not in ..
     - Use ffmpeg, but use pkg-config. Conditionally enable libdc1394.
     - Enable the gameengine.
     - Use CXX to link, rather than -lstdc++.
  * Possible improvements (regarding the build system options):
     - Maybe add libode0-dev to the B-D (not needed?).
     - Maybe add libalut-dev to the B-D (not needed?).
     - Maybe add libquicktime-dev to the B-D (FBTFS).
  * Ship a -dbg package. See how to deal with running gdb on blender
    because of the wrapper: how to make it intuitive to users? Maybe
    a --debug or --gdb option?
  * More items have been mentioned on the list, see the thread
    beginning at:
