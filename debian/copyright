Basically, Blender is now GPL'd:

  Copyright (C) 2002-2005 Blender Foundation.
  
  Blender is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it

  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)
  any later version.

On Debian GNU/Linux systems, the complete text of the GNU General
Public License can be found in /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL'.


However, the following license is offered as an alternative:

  Blender License (the "BL", see http://www.blender.org/BL/ ).
  
  Copyright (C) 2002-2005 Blender Foundation. All Rights Reserved.
  
  This text supersedes the previous BL description, called Blender License 1.0.
  
  When the Blender source code was released in 2002, the Blender Foundation reserved 
  the right to offer licenses outside of the GNU GPL. This so-called "dual license" 
  model was chosen to provide potential revenues for the Blender Foundation. 
  
  The BL has not been activated yet. Partially because;
  
  - there has to be a clear benefit for Blender itself and its community of 
    developers and users.
  - the developers who have copyrighted additions to the source code need to approve 
    the decision.
  - the (c) holder NaN Holding has to approve on a standard License Contract
  
  But most important; 
  
  - the Blender Foundation is financially healthy, based on community support
    (e-shop sales), sponsoring and subsidy grants
  - current focus for the Blender Foundation is to not set up any commercial
    activity related to Blender development.
  - the GNU GPL provides sufficient freedom for third parties to conduct business
    with Blender
  
  For these reasons we've decided to cancel the BL offering for an indefinite period.
  
  Third parties interested to discuss usage or exploitation of Blender can email 
  license@blender.org for further information.

  Chairman Blender Foundation.
